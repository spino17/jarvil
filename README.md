# JARVIL
Just A Rather Very Idiotic Language (JARVIL) is a programming language made for pure fun! I just wanted to learn how a prgramming language is made. This repo contains all my learnings on language design and writing a compiler. The patterns used in the implementation is heavily inspired by the famous dragon book on compilers (`Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools, Second Edition. Alfred V. Aho, Monica S. Lam, Ravi Sethi, Jeffrey D. Ullman`). Because of the descriptive nature of this repo, it can be used by anyone who wished to learn how to write a compiler.
